# Remote Hop

This docker image is a fork of [Linuxserver.io
openssh-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openssh-server) that
allows using port forwards and such for reverse ssh by changing some config
inside the original image.

Refer to the linuxserver.io docs of the original image for further info.
